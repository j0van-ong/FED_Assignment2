## Justifications
### Usage of advertisment block
As a puzzle game offered free of charge, the integration of an advertisement block serves as a necessary revenue stream to sustain ongiong development efforts and cover operational expenses.
### Usage of own database
The absence of a suitable, cost-free API was not found so the decision was made to establish and employ our own database. This approach affords greater control over data management, customization, and alignment with our specific requirements. 
### No implementation of log in/sign up page
This enhance user accessibility and minimizing friction in the user experience journey. By excluding the mandatory account creation processes, we aim to facilitate seamless and immediate access to the game, thereby fostering greater user engagement and satisfaction.
